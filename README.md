# Image-Background-Changer
This html webpage can change/replace the background of a image with the second image you provide.
This webpage can change images having background colors: green, blue, red and white.
To try this, some of the images have already be given. You can also use your own images.

Note: The images should have exact or near to exact complexion of the color you choose to change in the background.
      After testing it, I can say that this code is 70-80% accurate in giving satisfactory results.
      This program uses JavaScript to change the background.
